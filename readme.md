Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies, and run `npm start` to
start the automatic builder and test server. Then load `examples/hello-world/`
as an unpacked extension into Google Chrome.

The [Chrome Extensions
Reloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-reloader/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid)
extension is supported, and if it is detected then it will be triggered whenever
any changes are made to any SDK files, so that you don't have to click reload on
the test extension yourself on every change. (You'll still need to refresh
Gmail!)
